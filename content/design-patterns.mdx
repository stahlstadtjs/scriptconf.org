## Smart Responsive Interface Design Patterns

Are you ready for a design challenge? In this brand new workshop, Vitaly Friedman, editor-in-chief 
and co-founder of Smashing Magazine, will be taking a microscopic examination of common interface 
components and problems appearing in responsive user interfaces. In this workshop, we’ll be spending 
an entire day drawing and designing responsive interfaces, starting from accordions, to date/time pickers,
sliders, feature comparisons, car configurators all the way to insurance calculators and trip planners.

The workshop is intended for intermediate/advanced designers and developers who have an understanding of
responsive design and how it works. 

Most techniques are borrowed from mid-size and large-scale real-life projects, such as large eCommerce projects,
online magazines and web applications. We won't cover the basics, instead, the workshop covers more advanced — 
and often obscure and innovative techniques.

### What hardware/software do you need?

You'll need to bring a lot of creativity with your preferred coffee mug. We’ll be spending a lot of
time drawing, sketching, designing and thinking. Laptop is preferred but not absolutely necessary. 
You’ll need a lot of sleep reserves since it’s going to be a packed day. Bring a lot of attention to
detail and non-standard thinking to this one! ;-)
