Do I get an invoice when ordering a ticket?
: Yes, of course. Ti.to (our ticket service) produces an invoice according to European law, including VAT and every detail you need for your company.
Who's organising ScriptConf?
: ScriptConf organised by [Sebastian Gierlinger](https://twitter.com/sebgie) and [Stefan Baumgartner](https://twitter.com/ddprrt). Sebastian and Stefan also organize meetups like [Stahlstadt.js](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/stahlstadt-js/) and [Technologieplauscherl](https://technologieplauscherl.at). Both have been frequent visitors and speakers at conferences all over the world and let their experiences flow into the organisation of ScriptConf.
What is the language of the talks?
: Everything at the conference will be held in English: talks, moderation, catering.
What's included in my ticket?
: With your purchase for the main event you get an all-inclusive ticket to the conference, including the show, food, coffee, refreshments and of course the drinks at the after-show party.
: With your purchase for the workshop ticket you get coffee, refreshments and lunch. All next to an 8 hour course with our workshop host, of course.
Are student tickets available?
: Yes, we have a few student tickets available which are 66% of the original price. Send us an e-Mail to office (at) scriptconf.org and we give you all the necessary details.
Are tickets refundable/reassignable?
: You can reassign tickets up until the conference itself. Let us know if it's in the range of 7 days before the event, as we can't change the badge anymore. Tickets are not refundable, unless we cancel the event, then you get the full refund.
