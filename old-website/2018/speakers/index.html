<p>Evan is a developer, designer and creative coder. He is the author of Vue.js, a JavaScript framework for building modern web interfaces with reactive components.</p>
<p>In the past Evan worked at Meteor Development Group on the most starred full-stack JavaScript framework on GitHub, and before that spent two years at Google Creative Lab hacking on experimental UI prototypes for various Google products.</p>
<h4>The Journey to Full Time Open Source</h4>
<p>Working on open source has changed my life. I am self-employed and work on open source full-time. I don't have a boss. I only work on projects that I enjoy working on, and I can work whenever and wherever I want. I also let people use all the code I write for free. This is all made possible thanks to the amazing support from the community made up of the users of my open source projects.</p>
<p>I think I'm incredibly lucky to be in this position today. Yet there are still many open source maintainers struggling on the verge of burnout while their software is being used by millions. So in this talk I will share with you my journey of open source - in particular how I made it my full-time job - in the hope of shedding some insights on open source sustainability.</p>
<h4>Workshop on Jan, 18: <a href="/2018/workshops/evan">Vue.js</a></h4>
<p>We often reach for existing libraries when dealing with advanced app features such as routing, state management, form validation and i18n, and a lot of times the implementations behind these libraries can be a black box.</p>
<p>In this workshop we are going to build simple versions of such libraries from the ground up using basic Vue features.</p>
<p>This will help you better understand the nature of these problems and how to better leverage Vue’s reactivity system to come up with elegant solutions.</p>

<p>She loves co-leading the Accessibility Seattle meetup and a coding club for Girl Develop It Bellingham. When away from the keyboard, Marcy can be found hiking with her dog, riding a bicycle, or snowboarding.</p>
<h4>Radically Accessible Internet Applications 💯</h4>
<p>An accessible internet experience makes all the difference for a person with a disability, whether they're enjoying online entertainment, paying bills or booking a trip to go adaptive skiing. You see, people with disabilities gain privacy and independence when they can handle their own affairs. Wouldn't it be radical if every web application supported users with disabilities?</p>
<p>As JavaScript experts, we can enable more of our users by shipping accessible interfaces every time, and I'll show you how. In this talk, we'll audit a client-rendered web application for accessibility, making the necessary changes to support people with disabilities. The best part about it? By integrating accessibility into our development workflow, we'll make our apps more usable by everyone.</p>

<h4>Cycle.js on pen and paper</h4>
<p>Let's learn the Cycle.js framework from paper sketches and diagrams that make it look easy and obvious. Then, let's see how you can use it in the real world.</p>
<h4>Workshop on Jan, 18: <a href="/2018/workshops/andre">RxJS Deep Dive</a></h4>
<p>RxJS Observables are present in frontend frameworks like Angular and Cycle.js, and are useful in diverse contexts, from backend to frontend and also mobile apps. They are meant for organizing asynchronous code, but often look challenging to beginners.</p>
<p>Come learn the fundamental concepts behind RxJS and gain confidence programming with reactive Observables. RxJS In this workshop, Andre Staltz will guide you through lectures and exercises. Expect to see RxJS concepts demystified, practice with exercises, make questions, and gain confidence with the tools.</p>

<p>Phil’s career in web development spans almost 20 years and includes time as a Software Engineer at Verisign, an Open Source Evangelist at British Telecom, and Technology Director at R/GA where he worked with clients around the world such as Nike, Google, Beats By Dre and Samsung to bring engaging and effective experiences to the widest audience possible.</p>
<h4>Next wave infrastructure - do far more with much less</h4>
<p>Recent years have seen a shift in technical architectures. Building complex services for the web used to be just that – complex. Projects might have demanded a broad range of specialist skills which could stretch even the fullest of full-stack developers. These days we have a growing number of options for how we design, build and maintain the systems which keep our web sites and applications alive.</p>
<p>This talk will look at ways to make use of emerging tools and services which can deliver surprisingly rich features and capabilities without maintaining expensive and complex infrastructure. We’ll talk about the benefits in keeping your stack simple, in using the expertise of others, and we'll examine the performance and security benefits of JAMstack and microservices.</p>

<h4>Creating Augmented Reality Apps with Web Technology</h4>
<p>If 2017 was the year of Virtual Reality, 2018 may become the year of Augmented Reality. With Apple's ARKit for iOS and Google's ARCore for Android, we should not forget that actually the open web and Augmented Reality are the perfect couple.</p>
<p>But how do we create AR apps with web technology? In my talk you will learn how to write your own AR app that runs in the browser. You will see how Augmented Reality works, what markers are for, and how to create them. And you'll get an overview about the devices you can use to test your AR projects.</p>
<p>We are just at the beginning of the rise of Augmented Reality. This is why lots of UX design questions are still unanswered. But there are patterns and best practises, and you will learn how to use them to get a great user experience in your AR application.</p>

<p>When she's not prototyping projects mixing art and technology, she likes to mentor young developers and contribute to open-source.</p>
<h4>Look mum, no hands!</h4>
<p>A typical interaction with a device or interface involves touching it. Either you're pressing buttons on a controller, swiping on a touchscreen or clicking on your laptop's trackpad. But what if you could control things without the use of your hands? What if you could use... your thoughts?</p>
<p>I have been tinkering with a brain sensor and developed an open source JavaScript framework for it to allow me (or anyone else) to control interfaces or robots using facial expressions and mental commands.</p>
