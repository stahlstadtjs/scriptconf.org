## Dylan will talk on: Frameworks in a post-React apocalpyse

The date is the 25th of October, 2019, and the world has been struck by a mass extinction event. A biotechnical virus has wiped React from all GitHub repositories, books, and examples. We collectively vaguely remember the benefits of React, but cannot remember the specifics of its implementation. In this dark new world, we seek out new solutions to replace our trusted reactive library and fix our broken web. We’ll boldly go where only some have gone before, in search of a framework to meet our needs, and avoid a regression to our jQuery past.
