    <h2 id="workshop">Workshop on January 26th</h2>
    <p class="about-box">
      A day before the event we will hold a special React workshop with our friend Nik Graf from React Vienna.
    </p>

    <section class="divider on-top" id="nik">
      <img src="/assets/images/nik.jpg" alt="Nik Graf" class="divider-image">
      <div class="divider-content">
        <h3>Workshop host: Nik Graf</h3>
        <p>
          Nik is a developer with heavy focus on UX. He co-created several popular open source projects
          like DraftJS Plugins &amp; Carte Blanche and earlier this year Nik participated in Stripe’s Open
          Source Retreat. He organises the ReactJS Vienna Meet-up and recently joined the US startup Serverless.
        </p>
        <h2>Workshop: Advanced React Topics</h2>
        <p>
          React revolutionized the way we build user interfaces for the web today. Components are everywhere and
          most front-end frameworks nowadays have adopted a Virtual DOM under the hood.
        </p>
        <p>
          It didn't stop there. The rise of React triggered a many more innovations in the front-end development
          space. With so much movement in this space sometimes many of us struggled to keep up. The term JS Fatigue
          was born.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nik Graf was fortunate to have used many of these new technologies over the last couple years. In this
          workshop he will guide you through four modules. Each module will start with a brief presentation into
          the topic and followed by a coding exercise.
        </p>
        <h3>Schedule</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Higher Order Components</strong>: While you probably use them on a daily basis like Redux's
            connect there are many more use-cases. Nik will explain how they work and you will build a simple
            validation library with your own higher order components.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Snapshot testing with Jest</strong>: Testing components is a tedious process and therefor
            many just don't do it. Jest's snapshot feature makes testing components quick and fun.
          </li>
          <li><strong>The Dos and Don'ts with Redux</strong>: While Redux itself is fairly simple it isn't trivial
            how to organize your code, structure your reducers nor deal with side-effects. In this module we are
            going explore the tradeoffs of several approaches.
          </li>
          <li><strong>First Steps with GraphQL</strong>: During this session you will build your first GraphQL endpoint.
            Exciting! 🤗
          </li>
        </ol>
